# Customer Satisfaction Analysis for Airline Service
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer satisfaction in the airline service industry. The goal is to understand the factors influencing customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. The analysis is based on survey data from airline passengers and explores multiple service-related variables such as in-flight experience, customer service, and overall satisfaction.

# Dataset
The dataset contains customer responses related to their experiences with airline services, including:

Flight Information: Details about the flight such as flight duration and distance.
Service Quality: Ratings on aspects like in-flight service, cleanliness, and comfort.
Customer Information: Demographics, frequent flyer status, and ticket purchasing behavior.
Satisfaction: Overall satisfaction rating and likelihood of recommendation.

# Objectives
To identify the key factors that influence customer satisfaction in airline services.
To perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback.
To provide actionable insights for improving airline services and customer experience.

# Data Analysis Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of responses, detecting outliers, and visualizing key features affecting satisfaction.
Sentiment Analysis: Classifying customer feedback into positive and negative sentiments.
Modeling: Applying classification models such as logistic regression and decision trees to predict customer satisfaction levels.
Feature Importance: Identifying which factors (e.g., comfort, service, pricing) most strongly affect satisfaction.

# Results
Key Factors: In-flight service quality, customer service responsiveness, and flight comfort were found to be the most important factors influencing satisfaction.
Sentiment Trends: Customers generally expressed more positive sentiment towards short-duration flights and prompt services.
Predictive Models: The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of over 85% in predicting customer satisfaction based on service factors.
